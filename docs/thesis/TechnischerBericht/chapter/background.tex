The following section either introduces the tools and technologies used in bazo or references explanations of previous theses in the context of the bazo-blockchain. Furthermore the theses of other students working on the bazo-blockchain are referenced.

\section{Related work}
At the time of writing the thesis the bazo-blockchain contains the software systems as described in the following system context diagram \ref{systemcontextdiagram}. There are also some smaller tools which are not further described. In \ref{systemcontextdiagram} multiple miner instances are displayed to represent the blockchain and to describe how the miner interact with eachother.

The bazo-blockchain currently contains the following sub projects:
\begin{description}
  \item[Miner] The miner is at the heart of the blockchain. It validates transactions, keeps the ledger up to date and contacts other miners about new transactions or blocks.
  \item[Wallet] 
  \item[Virtual machine] The virtual machine executes the code of the contract.
  \item[Client] The client is used to create and send new transactions.
  \item[Block explorer] The block explorer is used to view transactions.
\end{description}

There are also some further small useful tools, like keygen but they are not further discussed here. The organization on github is accessible under the following link: \href{https://github.com/bazo-blockchain}{https://github.com/bazo-blockchain}.

In the \ref{systemcontainerdiagram} one of the miners is expanded which makes it possible to see it's packages and their relationships with other components.

\subsection{Previous work}
As the BAZO blockchain was started in 2017 there have been multiple theses within which different aspects of the blockchain were implemented. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bazo â€“ A Cryptocurrency from Scratch \cite{ba_miner}
	\item A Progressive Web App (PWA)-based Mobile Wallet for Bazo \cite{ba_wallet}
	\item A Blockchain Explorer for Bazo \cite{ba_explorer}
	\item Proof of Stake for Bazo \cite{ba_pos}
	\item Design and Prototypical Implementation of a Mobile Light Client for the Bazo Blockchain \cite{ba_client}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Similar existent projects}
A huge help in being able to reason by analogy were the open source repositories of NEO and Ethereum. We learned a lot by looking through their code while building our own VM. Basically all three projects (Bazo, Ethereum and NEO) are platforms for decentralized applications based on smart contracts. 

\subsubsection{NEO}
NEO is a blockchain project \flqq that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a smart economy with a distributed network.\frqq \cite{neovseth} Smart contracts for the Neo platform can be written in Java, C\#, VB.Net, F\#, Kotlin and Python. It is planned to add more programming languages in the near future such as Go, C, C++ and JavaScript. NEO utilizes a consensus mechanism called the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. NEO is implemented in C\#. \cite{neo_whitepaper}

\subsubsection{Ethereum}
The goal of Ethereum is to create a platform for the development of decentralized apps in order to create a \flqq more globally accessible, more free, and more trustworthy Internet, an internet 3.0\frqq. \cite{neovseth} There are multiple languages which can be used to write contracts for Ethereum. The most popular language is Solidity, a language inspired by JavaScript developed by the Ethereum developers. There are several implementations of the client such as go-ethereum (written in Go), cpp-ethereum (written in C++) and others. Ethereum's consensus mechanism is proof of work but  a proof of stake algorithm is already being developed and likely to go live in 2018.

\subsubsection{How do they differ from the Bazo Blockchain?}
Both, Ethereum and NEO are public, permission-less smart contract platforms. At the time of writing, the Bazo blockchain is a permissioned blockchain because of the initial requirements from the financial services provider. As for now, the Bazo blockchain is just a research project. The goal is to become a public, permission-less platform for decentralized applications. To reach this goal and be able to create and maintain a competitive blockchain, a dedicated team would be needed. 

\section{Background}
In this section the tools and technologies used to build the bazo-blockchain are explained.

\subsection{Blockchain}
A Blockchain is basically blocks of data chained together by hashing functions. The data inside these blocks are transactions. In order to make the non-repudiable digital signatures are used. The transactions are validated by a miner. The miner validates the signatures and checks if the assets transmitted by the transaction, usually tokens or coins representing a real monetary value, actually exists on the account of the other person. Since the bazo-blockchain is account based, it also updates the balance of the account according to the transmitted value. Previous theses in the context of Bazo dive deeper into cryptocurrencies and blockchains [BA lsige, MA chetelat].

\subsection{Smart contracts}
A smart contract is basically an agreement or contract written in computer code, saved in a transaction and therefore distributed over the whole network. The smart contract can then be called by another transaction an is executed by the miner. 

\subsection{Transactions}
In the context of data base management systems a transaction is a unit of work performed within the system. \cite{dbtransaction} This definition is also applicable for blockchains. As explained in \autoref{sec:transactionTypes}
there are multiple transaction types and only some are used to send coins. Others are used mostly to change the system state or create a new account.

\subsection{Virtual machine}
A process virtual machine is an abstraction layer on top of an operating system which abstracts the formulation of the problem from the code that is actually run on a machine in order to make the formulation platform independent.
