\textbf{Compiler} & 
Whilst it is already possible to write contracts using the operation codes of the vm, this is very hard to read for humans. To make the writing of contracts easier a compiler which processes a better understandable language for humans and translates it into the codes of the vm would be useful. \\ \\

\textbf{IDE} & 
There should also be an envirionment in which contracts can be written in the highlevel language and tested or even directly deployed. \\ \\

\raggedright
\textbf{of gas and currency} & 
This is useful because if the price of the currency rises, contract execution prices should not rise with it. \\ \\

\raggedright
\textbf{Contract pays the fee} & 
Calling a contract and executing a fuction on it should be paid by the contract instead of the caller. \\ \\

\raggedright
\textbf{Platform independent encoding} &
The mechanism with which transactions are encoded and send or received from the miner should be platform independant.\\ \\

\section{Conclusions}
Evaluation of the results of a contract and its equivalents run on differnt platforms.
