\section{Future Work}

\begin{description}
  \item[Compiler]  Whilst it is already possible to write contracts using the operation codes of the vm, this is very hard to read for humans. To make the writing of contracts easier a compiler which processes a better understandable language for humans and translates it into the codes of the vm would be useful. 
  \item[IDE] There should also be an envirionment in which contracts can be written in the highlevel language and tested or even directly deployed.

Merging of VM and client?


Maybe implement a feature which executes the vm on the client firsthand and if that result executed on the copies is ok then actually create the transaction. Expected value


\section{Conclusions}
Evaluation of the results of a contract and its equivalents run on differnt platforms.
