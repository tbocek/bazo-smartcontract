This document contains the bachelor thesis written by Ennio Meier and Marco Steiner, which was completed at the University of Applied Science Rapperswil in the spring semester 2018. The work was supervised by Prof. Dr. Thomas Bocek.
This thesis is focused on integrating Smart Contracts into the BAZO blockchain. The BAZO blockchain was started as a research project of the University of ZÃ¼rich in cooperation with a Financial Service Provider.

\textbf{The BAZO blockchain} & 
The first goal of BAZO as a research project, was to provide consumer bonus points based on blockchain technology for the financial service provider. The benefit of a decentralized blockchain based solution is the financial service provider only taking on the role as an exchange point of BAZO coins against a physical currency and not the role of the validator and book keeper of transactions themselves anymore. This allows businesses and customers to exchange goods more easily with these bonus coins than before, because they could determine the terms of business directly with each other and without the financial service provider as third party. \\ \\

\textbf{Evolution of BAZO} & 
Up until the writing of this thesis the requirements of the financial service provider have been satisfied in previous theses. The project is now continued by Thomas Bocek. In the spirit of the name BAZO which means base in esperanto, Thomas has the vision for BAZO \flqq Becoming a blockchain 10x better than Ethereum\frqq, whereas Ethereum is becoming a platform or foundation for decentralized apps. \\ \\

\textbf{Scope of the work} & 
As smart contracts are an important part of the foundation on which such distributed applications are built on, this thesis provides the environment on which such smart contracts can be run on by building a virtual machine and the integration of it in the Miner. \\ \\

\section{Motivation}
In the context of automation, speed and transparency smart contracts provide a huge benefit to the blockchain.

\begin{tabular}[t]{ p{3cm} p{12.5cm}}
\textbf{Context} & 
As a basic blockchain solves the problem of keeping track on who owns what and making transactions of such goods, there is still a huge chance for automation and reliability. In this stage the blockchain is basically just a ledger but with the integration of smart contracts, one transaction can trigger a multitude of different actions which otherwise had to be executed manually. Triggering the execution of a smart contract is much faster and more reliable than a human reacting to a received transaction towards one account. The limitation here is of course that there has to be a set of transaction whichs can be dealt with in the same manner what usually is the case. \\ \\

\textbf{Chance} & 
As transaction speed and cost approach nearly zero compared to traditional payment systems like paying a bill at the post office, it is more and more feasible to make even very small transactions. This could be used to pay content creators like journalists, artists or musicians fairer by using smart contracts creating a small transaction each time a video or article is viewed.
Having provided the base of course many other things can be built upon such a system.\\ \\

\textbf{Solution} & 
Since the participants of the blockchain are free to exchange coins for goods or services, a smart contract facilitates these value transactions as it states in a programming language according to what terms a party is ready to do business with other parties and also makes such transactions faster as there is no involvement of humans in order to verify or execute the transaction. One can be sure that a valid call of the contract results in its execution according to the terms described in it.

\section{Description of work}
As mentioned before this thesis is concerned with the integration of smartcontracts into the bazo blockchain. The goal of contract integration contained multiple subgoals. First a Virtual Machine had to be built which is able to execute the code later stored on the blockchain. The second subgoal was to implement the vm into the miner of the bazo blockchain because contract execution should be part of transaction verfication.
