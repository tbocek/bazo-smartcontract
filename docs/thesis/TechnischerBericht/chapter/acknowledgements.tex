In this section we would like to thank Prof. Dr. Thomas Bocek. We were continuously impressed about his enthusiasm for Blockchain technology and his knowledge about it. There were many occasions where we were extraordinarily grateful being able to contribute to the BAZO blockchain, since building your own virtual machine really brings great insight into how a computer works on a lower level or how some of the programming languages are platform independent. We're convinced having worked on such a new and possibly groundbreaking technology has great benefits for our future careers.
