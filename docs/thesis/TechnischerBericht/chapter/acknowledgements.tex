	In this section we would like to thank Prof. Dr. Thomas Bocek for his assistance and inputs throughout. We were continuously impressed about his enthusiasm for Blockchain technology and his knowledge about it. There were many occasions where we were extraordinarily grateful being able to contribute to the Bazo Blockchain, for example building your own virtual machine really brings great insight into how a computer works on a lower level or how some of the programming languages are platform independent. We are convinced having worked on such a new and possibly groundbreaking technology has great benefits for our future careers.
	
	We would also like to thank the other students for their work on the Bazo Blockchain. It has been an educative experience to work on such a fast-growing project that takes many different aspects into account.
