I've never worked with Marco before this project. After a short talk we decided to do the thesis together. After the presentation of the topics and a subsequent discussion with Thomas it was soon clear that we wanted to do this thesis. The cooperation worked very well. We were both very committed and dealt with the subject thoroughly. Of course, there were also disagreements, but we were always able to reach a compromise. I think that a willingness to compromise and the ability to take criticism are also important learning objectives of a joint Bachelor's thesis. This thesis was very contrary to my student research project. In this thesis, the focus was much more on implementation. We also worked truly agile and not according to the waterfall principle, which worked very well for me. I was able to learn a lot in this thesis, especially in the area of blockchain and about how computers work on a deeper level. Thomas has supported us from the very beginning. Thomas always gave us meaningful and well thought-out feedback, which showes that he is an expert in this field. He was often available for spontaneous meetings and even took us to Trust Square, a co-working space for blockchain companies.
